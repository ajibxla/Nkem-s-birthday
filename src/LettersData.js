      "I hope a smile emerged from the corners of your mouth as your eye lashes flustered as part of your morning rituals that beckon that you‚Äôre ready to open your beautiful eyes.\n\nIt‚Äôs been over nine months doing life with you and to be fair, it‚Äôs been an interesting one. I have learnt to love and loved to learn.\n\nBeing with you has made me a better brother, son and, friend. Most importantly, a better lover.\n\nThe future is pregnant and there are still a lot of uncertainties along the way. But one thing that I‚Äôm certain of is that I won‚Äôt stop loving you.\n\nCome what may. Come rain. Come sunshine. Come fake breakups. Come real breakups. Come emigration. Come anything that life throws at us. Me loving you is one thing  I‚Äôm sure of.\n\nClosing this with a song that you made me fall in love with.\n\n‚ÄúWise men say, only fools rush in. But I can‚Äôt help falling in love with you‚Äù\n\n am grateful that I rushed in. I am grateful that I‚Äôm a fool for love. A fool for you.\n\nGood morning my love.",

      "Tough day right ? I am so so sorry about this.\n\nIf wishes were horses, you'd never have a tough day in your life.\n\nBut not to worry, I will ensure we have a future where you and our kids do not get to have toughs days again.\n\nI understand that red Nkem came around. And this time, with a lot of gusto and energy. But I know that you are stronger than any red blood cell trying to force its way out of you.\n\nI hope that you have had you shower, ate dinner, and is probably just taking the stress of the day out on your bed. Please help inform Chimamada (if she is home) to respect herself and be a good niece today. My girlfriend needs a beauty rest.\n\nI will be leaving you to the rest of your ever blissful evening. My phone is currently on DND as I need to make some adjustments to the Tender Landing Page (we are going live soon).",

      "I trust that you that you had a great night.\n\nThis is my second attempt at writing an epistle for you. I attempted writing a prose like poem. A poem intended to set your cheeks on fire, but unfortunately it was not adding up. The words to describe how you make me feel were not flowing. Every sentence that I penned down sort of underestimated what you meant to me. Hence why I opted for the form which I am most comfortable in.\n\nNkem, I wrote that you were the silver lining in my blue sky but you are beyond that. You are not a purple patch in my life nor  the sign of good things to come. Rather, you are the good thing in my life.\n\nI wanted to remind you that I was in this for the long haul. A long haul seems to have an end but you know what? I am not thinking about an end with you. I want to be your Romeo with emotional intelligence and good communication skills. I want to be your Jack who is strong enough to swim across the freezing sea to get the both of us to safety.\n\nNkem, certainties and uncertainties are a part of life and they  define our human existence. Right now, I am not certain about what I want to have for breakfast but I am certain about having breakfast. Bringing this back to us. I am not certain about what the future might hold but I am certain that I want it to be with you. I understand that this might sound too soon to your ears. You have probably heard this a million times from other people but that's my truth.\n\nNkem, there are times when you would doubt why you are doing this with me. There are times that you would push me to the edge of insanity. We can blame it on mood swings, or even the hormones. But in this situations I want us to hold onto the fact that we like each other.\n\nNkem, I do not know how love works. I have never felt such way with anyone outside my immediate family but with you I am ready to learn the ropes. Heck, I am already learning the ropes.\n\nOn this note, I bring my good morning message to an end. I honestly miss sending you good morning texts. The `Good morning my baby girl` and `How was your night?` have gotten boring.\n\nBy the way, I also tried avoiding talking about how you look. Why? Because I have talked about this for n years and you are probably tired from receiving compliments. What else do I want to say about? The beautiful arc that forms on your face when you smile  and the cute sets of teeth that emerge? Your lovely eyeballs that leaves me enthralled or  the warmth that comes with laying in your arms? Fam. It just hit me that I am stuck on you (Listen to Kahli Abdu's stuck on you for reference).\n\nLest I forget, Happy Birthday to your mum. I wish her long life and prosperity in good health and wealth. Shout out to her for blessing the world with a soul like yours.",
